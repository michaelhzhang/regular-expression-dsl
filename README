1) One thing that was annoying was I didn't realize how incomplete the provided 
example code was. For example, SimpleParserWithParseTree didn't properly 
handle nested expressions, which was confusing me for a while as I used it as a 
template. Similarly, it was unclear that it's not actually necessary to put e.g.
"(" or ")" in the actual parse tree itself.
2) It took me a while to actually understand how the recursive descent algorithm worked;
it took running through a few examples step by step to understand it
3) It was unclear where in the notes to find the NFA simulation algorithm since
it was hidden in NFAtoDFA.pdf
